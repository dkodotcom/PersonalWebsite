## About

This landing page was my very first project as a developer. My hopes were to learn to design a website that would be aesthetically clean, while learning front-end along the way. Very big shout out to my mentor, Michelle Levine @michellejl, who had the patience to guide me through the CSS trickeries. I designed this site around my minimalist (or strive-to-be) lifestyle. Cleaner, mo bettah!
