## About

This landing page was my very first project as a developer. My hopes were to learn to design a website that would be aesthetically clean, while learning front-end along the way. Very big shout out to my mentor, Michelle Levine @michellejl, who had the patience to guide me through the CSS trickeries. I designed this site around my minimalist (or strive-to-be) lifestyle. Cleaner, mo bettah!

## History

Originally, my first commit was pure HTML and CSS, which would be landingpage.html and landingpage.css. After deciding I wanted to use flexbox as the responsive framework, I committed landingpage2.html and landingpage.css which on retro, was a bit redundant.. I guess I wanted to show progression! hehe.
